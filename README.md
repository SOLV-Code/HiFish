# HiFish

*E komo mai / Welcome*

Hawaiian language pack for the *rosettafish* package

## Basic Idea

The [rosettafish package](https://github.com/pbs-assess/rosettafish) is designed to automate the translation of fisheries-related words and short phrases, so that multilingual versions of technical versions can be easily generated in R. *rosettafish* has a built in dictionary for English, French, and Inuktitut, but also allows for customized dictionary files.

The purpose of this repository is to build English-Hawaiian dictionary files and develop some illustrations of how to use them. 

*HiFish* is part of the [FishLang](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/FishLang) family of language extensions, which currently also includes [GaelFish](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/GaelFish) (GÃ idhlig / Scottish Gaelic) and [FinnFish](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/FinnFish) (Suomi / Finnish).
